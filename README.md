# Aaron's Recommended Extensions

As a Windows Insider and a curious guy, I needed to reinstall VS Code many times
doing to System crashes that required SO reinstallations or just because I wanted
to try a different Linux distribution.
(I know I could've done those things inside a VM, and I've done it sometimes,
but you know that OSes on bare metal are much faster...)

Well... To avoid needing to search the extensions every time that I reinstalled VS Code,
or needed to use a different machine, I created this Extension Pack.

Here you will find from miscellaneous things like Theme and Icon Packs, to
language support and productivity extensions like Prettier, GitLens, GistPad,
Typescript, React and Angular Snippets, and many more.

Feel free to check my recommended extensions and just install those that fit for
you.

> **Note** -
> I only did the extension pack. None of the extensions included were made by me.

If you want to reproduce my entire workspace, take a look at my
[settings.json](https://gist.github.com/euaaron/adfb4b344320298ec985c58b508f4edb).
