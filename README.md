# Aaron's Recommended Extensions

As a Windows Insider and a curious guy, I had to migrate from computers and
format the machine many times... because that, I had to search and re-install all
my essential softwares, and vs code extensions.

To avoid needing to search the extensions everytime that I uninstall VS Code,
or use a different machine or system, I created this Extension Pack.

Here you will find from miscelaneous things like Theme and Icon Packs, to
language support and productivity extensions like Prettier, GitLens, GistPad,
Typescript, React and Angular Snippets, and many more.

Feel free to check my recommended extensions and just install those that fit for
you.

Note: I only did the extension pack. None of the extensions included were made by me.

If you want to reproduce my entire workspace, take a look at my VS Code
[settings.json](https://gist.github.com/euaaron/adfb4b344320298ec985c58b508f4edb).
